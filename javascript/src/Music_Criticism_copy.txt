His music is largely improvisatory in nature, nourished by interests in natural progressions, reverberant bass accents and inter-wreathed textural deployments. 

His sonic jaunts draw upon the visceral aesthetics of dub, techno, garage and impractical melodic leitmotifs of experimental electro-acoustics, fusing them into imaginative new musical opportunities. His music has been described as “vaporous”, “aching and expansive”, “a wicked dub abstraction” or as a BigShot magazine article put it, “Jamaica-meets-Detroit with jazz legend Eric Dolphy at the helm”.

Schenkerian analysis https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schenkerian_analysis

- developing a theory of hierarchically organized levels of elaboration 
- called prolongational levels, voice–leading levels (Stimmführungsschichten), or transformations (Verwandlungen), the idea being that each of the successive levels represents a new freedom taken with respect to the rules of strict composition.[5]

- the mere duplication of nature cannot be the object of human endeavour. Therefore [...] the overtone series [...] is transformed into a succession, a horizontal arpeggiation, which has the added advantage of lying within the range of the human voice. Thus the harmonic series is condensed, abbreviated for the purposes of art".[9]

- . Chords arise from within chords, as the result of the combination of passing notes and arpeggiations: they are at first mere embellishments, mere voice-leading constructions, but they become tonal spaces open for further elaboration and, once elaborated, can be considered structurally significant: they become scale-steps properly speaking. Schenker recognizes that "there are no rules which could be laid down once and for all" for recognizing scale steps,[12] but from his examples one may deduce that a triad cannot be recognized as a scale-step as long as it can be explained by passing or neighboring voice-leading.

- The Urlinie unfolds the tonal space in a melodic dimension, while the Bassbrechung expresses its harmonic dimension

 Schenker first conceived the Urlinie, the "fundamental line", as a kind of motivic line characterized by its fluency, repeated under different guises throughout the work and ensuring its homogeneity

Articulation of the span from I to V in the bass arpeggiation[edit]
The canonic form of the bass arpeggiation is I–V–I. The second interval, V–I, forms under scale degree 2–scale degree 1 the perfect authentic cadence and is not susceptible of elaboration at the background level. The first span, I–V, on the other hand, usually is elaborated. The main cases include:[48]
