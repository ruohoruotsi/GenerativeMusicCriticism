with strands and echoes reminiscent of David Lynch, Harold Budd, Deathprod, Tomas Koner, Erik Satie, Eno and Badalamenti weaving in and out of eachother for a quietly monumental trip that's in turn immersive, melancholy and relentlessly visceral. It's just a masterpiece of submerged composition - miss out at your peril. 

The Trunk label is well-versed in pulling considerable tricks out of its , but the release this week of the original 1979 score to seminal BBC documentary 'Life on Earth' has got to be its most moving and successful endeavour yet. It's really quite hard to believe that this sublime music has been languishing on a shelf somewhere for the last 30 years, so God bless Jonny Trunk for once again stepping in to ensure that we all know whats good and right in the world. If you've been taken-in by the  are so good at, or have a penchant for the Radiophonic Workshop, we implore you to invest. 


It's an unbelievable week for deep, dark and supremely heavy dancefloor wares, with 



from Untold keeping us gasping for breath, while 
- uber-influential Berlin producer T++ takes on Monolake for a sick double-header. 




 there's echoes of Eno, Koner, Deathprod, Debussy, Badalamenti and Lynch executed with a dark yet emotional determination encapsulating the spirit of a Berlin or Manchester nightscape,

making an indelible impression on the sonic psyche of anyone who's stood in its path.



	
		
stretching from the peripheries of Earth's maudlin blues-scapes to blissfully noisy and psychedelic ragas reminiscent of Pandit Pran Nath or Om. 

- evolving his sheets of blissed guitar noise with a towering command worthy of Fennesz or Keith Fullerton Whitman.



As far as the ever-swelling ranks of modern classical recordings go, this one aligns itself more with the wild and unharnessed feel that characterises Richard Skelton's work - certainly more so than the comparatively sculpted catalogues of Max Richter and Johann Johannsson. 


 
 
one of the finest additions to the dub-tech canon you're likely to hear this year

shirking any dubstep responsibilities to reveal an extra dope instrumental hiphop rhythm, sounding like Flying Lotus jamming with Lukid after a particularly relaxing sauna session.

Every so often a record drops that manages to encapsulate the zeitgeist of a scene with pinpoint accuracy.

After months of gestation, the EPIC triple CD set from Leyland Kirby is at long last available for public consumption. Containing over 4 hours of music spread across three cd's, each one comes housed in its own slipcase specially designed by painter Ivan Seal and then held in a special outer carrier, protecting its emotionally fragile core. If you've yet to cross paths with this music, prepare yourself for an extended sitting with some of the most absorbing sounds you'll have the pleasure of hearing this year, with strands and echoes reminiscent of David Lynch, Harold Budd, Deathprod, Tomas Koner, Erik Satie, Eno and Badalamenti weaving in and out of eachother for a quietly monumental trip that's in turn immersive, melancholy and relentlessly visceral. It's just a masterpiece of submerged composition - miss out at your peril.

The Trunk label is well-versed in pulling considerable tricks out of its box of musical treats, but the release this week of the original 1979 score to seminal BBC documentary 'Life on Earth' has got to be its most moving and successful endeavour yet. It's really quite hard to believe that this sublime music has been languishing on a shelf somewhere for the last 30 years, so God bless Jonny Trunk for once again stepping in to ensure that we all know whats good and right in the world. If you've been taken-in by the woozy nature film interludes Boards of Canada are so good at, or have a penchant for the Radiophonic Workshop, we implore you to invest.


It's an unbelievable week for deep, dark and supremely heavy dancefloor wares, with a mindblowing percussive headcrush from Instra:Mental and a tweaked post-garage-rave-tropical blinder from Untold keeping us gasping for breath, while uber-influential Berlin producer T++ takes on Monolake for a sick double-header. Grievous Angel, meanwhile, unleashes one of the most crucial twelves of the year with his Bubblez alter-ego, Ben Klock and Norman Nodge take on the Sandwell crew for another strictly limited pressing, Scuba presses up a mighty doublepack of deadly bass variations, and production unit Clouds impress once again with a sick little twelve that we particularly like for the frayed, Flying Lotus-style bass reduction on the flip.

It really is another one of those relentlessly heavy weeks, so before we go props/mentions must go to the truly resplendent Elm album on the Digitalis label, Danny Norbury and Library Tapes collaborating under the 'Le Lendemain' moniker, Matias Aguayo's excellent new album for Kompakt, an amazing split LP on Touch from Eleh/Nana April Jun plus releases from Dam Funk, Clubroot, Naphta, Sully, Silkie, Flow Dan, Ikonika, Cold Cave, Greg Davis, Celer, Jesu, Boris and much much more.


*AN INCREDIBLE TRIPLE CD PACKAGE CONTAINING OVER 4 HOURS OF MUSIC, HOUSED IN A CUSTOM OUTER CARD SLIPCASE, WITH INDIVIDUALLY PACKAGED CD'S INSIDE FEATURING ORIGINAL ARTWORK BY IVAN SEAL* Finally packaged together for all the non-vinyl believers, or simply those who are too glum to get up and turn the record over, Leyland Kirby's 'Sadly The Future Is No Longer What It Was' triple CD crate-set brings the series to an epic close, or an opening, depending on your perspective. For folk who have followed the arc from The Caretaker through to Leyland Kirby, this series has provided some of the most visceral, absorbing, disturbing, and bleakly beautiful musical journeys of the last few years, making an indelible impression on the sonic psyche of anyone who's stood in its path. In CD form, each disc features new and specially painted artwork from Ivan Seal, and similarly, no tracklistings or liner notes, other than the title. This is partly designed to reinforce the ambient/amnesiac effect of the recordings, and partly to reflect the library record-like anonymity of the music within. As its predecessor - the Caretaker project - started out making use of loops taken from dusty 78's found in a Stockport record shop, both out of a DIY necessity, and a willingness to engage with a forgotten past, the Leyland Kirby series has turned into a very personal project for its creator James Kirby. To give some background to the feelings exposed in this music Kirby himself says "Here we stand, twenty years on from the first CD, and our optimism has been gradually eroded away collectively. 'Tomorrows World' never came. We are lost and isolated, many of us living our lives through social networks as we try to make sense of it all, becoming voyeurs not active participants. Documenting everything. No Mystery. Everything laid bare for all to see". A pessimistic, but brutally honest outlook which he articulates with a very particular accent in his music. For us, there's echoes of Eno, Koner, Deathprod, Debussy, Badalamenti and Lynch executed with a dark yet emotional determination encapsulating the spirit of a Berlin or Manchester nightscape, but it's all open to interpretation and we're sure you'll try and work this one out for yourself. Truly life affirming sounds, and without doubt one of the most important, substantial releases of the year.
