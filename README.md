Generative Music Criticism
========================



### About ###

As a label manager Ruoho Ruotsi wrote copy for artist profiles, featured releases, promo reviews, tweets, onesheets, blog posts & online commentary, amassing a prodigious collection of musical phrases, idiomatic expressions and colourful constructions.
								 
These reviews are fashioned using Ruoho's custom [context-free grammar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context-free_grammar), [RiTa](https://github.com/dhowe/RiTa) and "hottt" artist [charts](http://developer.echonest.com/docs/v4/artist.html#top-hottt) pulled down in realtime from [The Echo Nest](http://developer.echonest.com).
								
								
Ruoho hopes these reviews will dislodge writer's block, suggest new musical vistas, creative possibilities, artist collaborations and perhaps garner a few chuckles.
