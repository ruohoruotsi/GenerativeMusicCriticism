### [What](http://ruohoreviews.com) ###

* What if [Timbaland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timbaland) produced [Stromae](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stromae) for [Kompakt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kompakt) records? 
* What if [Taylor Swift](https://instagram.com/taylorswift) & [Theo Parrish](http://www.residentadvisor.net/dj/theoparrish) fraternized to transcend the pedestrian screeching that beleaguers her pop balladry? 
* What if [Kanye](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanye_West) indulged in tranquil, free-floating chorales? 
* What if [Flying Lotus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_Lotus) teamed up with [Tujiko Noriko](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tujiko_Noriko) to rescript pirouetting, melodic [Zouglou](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zouglou).

These reviews are a creative writing experiment that (re)imagines an alternative musical cosmos where dissimilar musical expressions intermingle, unshackled by time, geography and class. 

### How ###

First-class criticism allows the reader to escape flatland, putting her in the front-row or inside the recording booth. But as a critic and writer:

 * How do you reflect the spirit of the music? 
 * How do you avoid descriptive repetition? 
 * How do you keep :hankey: fresh? 

### Who ###
As a label manager Ruoho Ruotsi wrote copy for artist profiles, featured releases, promo reviews, tweets, onesheets, blog posts & online commentary, amassing a prodigious collection of musical phrases, idiomatic expressions and colourful constructions.
								 
These reviews are fashioned using Ruoho's probabilistic [context-free grammar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context-free_grammar), [RiTa](https://github.com/dhowe/RiTa) and "hottt" artist [charts](http://developer.echonest.com/docs/v4/artist.html#top-hottt) pulled down from [The Echo Nest](http://developer.echonest.com).
								
								
As a regular reader of the [Oxford American](http://www.oxfordamerican.org), [Pitchfork](https://pitchfork.com), [Boomkat](https://boomkat.com), [The Fader](http://www.thefader.com) & [The Wire](https://www.thewire.co.uk), Ruoho hopes these reviews will dislodge writer's block, suggest new musical vistas, artist collaborations & even garner a few chuckles. For connoisseurs & entertainment purposes only.
