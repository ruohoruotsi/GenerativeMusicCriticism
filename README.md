* What if [Timbaland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timbaland) produced [Stromae](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stromae) for [Kompakt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kompakt) records? 
* What if [Taylor Swift](https://instagram.com/taylorswift) & [Theo Parrish](http://www.residentadvisor.net/dj/theoparrish) fraternized to transcend the pedestrian screeching that beleaguers her pop balladry? 
* What if [Kanye](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanye_West) indulged in tranquil, free-floating chorales? 
* What if [Flying Lotus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_Lotus) teamed up with [Tujiko Noriko](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tujiko_Noriko) to rescript pirouetting, melodic [Zouglou](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zouglou).

These reviews are a creative writing experiment that (re)imagines an alternative musical cosmos where dissimilar musical expressions intermingle, unshackled by time, geography and class. 

As a label manager Ruoho Ruotsi wrote copy for artist profiles, featured releases, promo reviews, tweets, onesheets, blog posts & online commentary, amassing a prodigious collection of musical phrases, idiomatic expressions and colourful constructions.
								 
These reviews are fashioned using Ruoho's custom [context-free grammar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context-free_grammar), [RiTa](https://github.com/dhowe/RiTa) and "hottt" artist [charts](http://developer.echonest.com/docs/v4/artist.html#top-hottt) pulled down in realtime from [The Echo Nest](http://developer.echonest.com).
								
								
Ruoho hopes these reviews will dislodge writer's block, suggest new musical vistas, creative possibilities, artist collaborations and perhaps garner a few chuckles.
